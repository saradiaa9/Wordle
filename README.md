# Wordle

Wordle is a Prolog-based word guessing game where players must guess a secret five-letter word within a limited number of guesses. 

## Installation

To install Wordle, follow the instructions for your operating system:
- **Windows**: Download and install [SWI-Prolog](http://www.swi-prolog.org/Download.html)
- **macOS**: Install using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/): `brew install swi-prolog`
- **Linux**: Install using your package manager, or download from the [SWI-Prolog website](http://www.swi-prolog.org/Download.html)

## Usage

To start the game, open a terminal and navigate to the project directory. Start the Prolog interpreter by running `swipl`. Load the main file by typing `[wordle].` and pressing Enter.

During gameplay, players must guess a five-letter word. After each guess, the game will display which letters are correct and in the correct position, and which letters are correct but in the wrong position. The goal is to guess the secret word within the limited number of guesses.

## Acknowledgements

This project was inspired by the classic word guessing game, and by the many talented developers who have created similar projects before us. We also want to thank the Prolog community for their support and contributions to the open-source ecosystem.
